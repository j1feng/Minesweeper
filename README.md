# Minesweeper

Suggested by my pro coder friend. Got practice in JS and JQ. Minesweeper Game. Got help from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iscLNDuFLHU&amp;t=1207s (license included for copyright reason) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFU5ZlrR21E. 

I took a lot of time to re-code the first video on my own, (although failed miserably so i just copied its style and some functions) and added more original functions, such as prevention of losing on the first click and right-click flag

Here are some problems as im a ucsd cse8a level coder and a bum:

- It should have a timer and lowest time record (yeah like my snake game)

- It uses multiple game file because I failed to change the map size parameter in the js function (cancer)

- Flag text display in html did not change as I add more flags. (html === cancer)

- i love minecraft.

# Minesweeper
Suggested by my pro coder friend. Got practice in JS and JQ. Minesweeper Game. Got help from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iscLNDuFLHU&amp;t=1207s ( in which I copied its style and functions) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFU5ZlrR21E. 

Here are some problems as im a ucsd cse8a level coder and a bum:

- It should have a timer and lowest time record (yeah like my snake game)

- It uses multiple game file because I failed to change the map size parameter in the js function (cancer)

- Flag text display in html did not change as I add more flags. (html === cancer)

- i love minecraft.
